# Breast-Cancer-Machine-Learning-Prediction-System
Using Python Machine Learning Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Models on Jupyter Notebook 

- Report on the various Machine Learning Models on Winconsin  Breast Cancer Data Set in the PDF as provided. 

Abstract: 
In Part A, we will use linear regression. The data has been experimented with 2 types of linear regression 
model: Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression. 

In Part B and C, we will use a different  dataset which is on Breast Cancer data to apply to supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. 
Breast cancer is the second highest cause of death from cancer among women, in the case of United 
States. Breast cancer occurs as a result of tumours in the breast tissue. 

The intention of this study is to 
design an accurate prediction system through various machine learning models of Python to predict 
whether a tumour is malignant or benign. 

The usage of machine learning and deep learning techniques in 
healthcare analysis and diagnostics is growing rapidly. Most of the possible medical flaws can be 
minimized by using classification models that also allow the data to be analysed faster, more accurately 
and more comprehensively (Kumari and Singh,2018).
